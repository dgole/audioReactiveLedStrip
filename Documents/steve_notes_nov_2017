Steve's notes getting this thing up and running Nov 8 2017

- The readme says vis.py is the main program, but that fle doesn't eem to exist in this repo
- When I try to run spectrum1.py or visualizationOriginal.py on my mbp I get an error saying there's no pyaudio
	Fixed by running
			brew install portaudio
			and then pip install pyaudio
- Is this meant for python 2 or 3?
